Introduction:
Some boasting about results. Why convert to Haskell.
Cite LINQ.

Literature:
Chapter -- section
Query avalanche problem needs definition.
Describe Haskell
bolding and italics.
Define a thing when first introducing it.
More explanation in general
Look over the quoting and what is happenning.

Problem analysis:
More on the proof single query from Cheney paper. Just the result is enough.
More explicit that the same normalisation are used and therefore the validity of the results.

Development:
HLINQ in the introduction. Maybe in the name as well.

Better summarisation of the query.
Add discussion of sizes of queries.
